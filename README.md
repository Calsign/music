# music

An Android music player built with Flutter. Uses MusicBrainz to fetch
music catalog information and uses the NewPipe APIs to find and play
YouTube videos that (hopefully) correspond to the correct song.

Note that this project probably violates the Google/YouTube T.O.S., so
use at your own risk. There are also ethical concerns because there is
no mechanism for compensating artists for their work. I have created
this solely for fun and don't use it as my primary music player.
